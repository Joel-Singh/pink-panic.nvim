# Pink Panic - A Lush Theme for Neovim

A simple and pretty pink colorscheme for Neovim made with [Lush](https://github.com/rktjmp/lush.nvim), born in the despair of not finding cute light themes. It may not be the easiest on the eyes, but I think it's really pretty.

Some things may seem out of place or not harmonious at all. It could be that I know nothing of color theory or just default values that I didn't bother to change. If this happens you can contact me at my twitter, [@Scysta](https://twitter.com/scysta), or just open an issue here. I'll still be doing changes when I deem it appropiate, though.

I hope you like it!
